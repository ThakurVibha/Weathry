## Weathry

✔ Developed a weather application by consuming REST API with the help of volley library to fetch news data and display the same on screen.

✔ Created networking layer to make the call to the current Open weather map API https://home.openweathermap.org/ and parsed the response.

✔ The method used is asynchronous to keep our UI responsive while we wait for the result, Instead, the calling thread is notified when the reply arrives.

✔ Application is capable to fetch weather state, humidity and temperature of any state and city across the globe.
