## Weathry

✔ Developed a weather application by consuming REST API https://home.openweathermap.org/ with the help of volley library to fetch news data and display the same on screen

✔ Creatednetworking layerto make the call to the currentOpen weather map APIand parsed the response

✔ The method used is asynchronous to keep our UI responsive while we wait for the result, Instead, the calling thread is notified when the reply arrives.

✔ Application is capable to fetch weather state, humidity and temperature of any state and city across the globe
